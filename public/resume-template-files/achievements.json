Added solar light to the parking lot since the parking lot would get very dark at night during some night time meetings.\n2. Cleaned up garbage for the thrift shop.\n3. There was a clay area that could not group grass, so we added a wooden edge and filled in blue stone to make it look nicer.\n4. Removed a lilac tree"
